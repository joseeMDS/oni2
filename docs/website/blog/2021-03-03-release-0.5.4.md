## What's new in 0.5.4

### Snippets

Snippet support is a feature that has been a long-time coming - it's one of the (many) features that motivated Onivim in the first place.

For my personal workflow, it was pretty difficult to set up seamless snippet support on all the platforms I work on. So having an it-just-works experience for snippets
is an exciting milestone for Onivim 2!

In 0.5.4, snippets are enabled, and Onivim comes with some built-in snippets for several languages:

In addition, many extensions provide additional snippets for languages. I really like this set of snippets for Markdown:

From the command palette - there are now options to configure user snippets:

Finally, snippets can be bound to a key as well:

There's some more information about the snippet syntax in our [documentation](https://onivim.github.io/docs/using-onivim/snippets)

### Emmet Integration

With snippets enabled, and some other blocking bugs fixed around completion - Onivim can now leverage the bundled Emmet extension to support basic expansions:

This is enabled by default for `html`, `css`, `less`, and `sass` - but we recommend some [configuration settings](https://onivim.github.io/docs/using-onivim/emmet#recommended-configuration) to get the best experience wtih Emmet.

### Visual-block fixes

One core building block of the snippet functionality was enabling multiple-selection edits, or multiple-insert edits - basically, a baby step towards full multiple-cursor support.

Another long-standing issue with Onivim was the lack of visual-block edits - using `I` and `A` to edit multiple lines at once. 

Onivim now uses this multiple-insert functionality to support visual-block edits:

![visual-block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13532591/109027545-c39c8c80-7675-11eb-89c4-2008a34d9632.gif)

Functionally, this should behave the same as using `I` and `A` in Vim - but gives you the benefit of visual feedback as-you-type.

### Extension host bug fixes

We've upgraded the extension host to 1.53.0 - keeping Onivim within a month of the VSCode update cadence.

There were several fixes to extensions in this release:

- [#3007](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3007) - Show 'missing dependency' activation error to user
- [#3016](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3016) - Fix memory leak in extension host language features

- [#3030](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3030) - Implement workspace storage
- [#3123](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3123) - Fix failure to install extensions over 10MB
- [#3054](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3054) - Implement 'isIncomplete' handler for completion

### Vim bug fixes

Aside from the fixes around visual-block insert/append, there were a few other Vim-side fixes that made it into 0.5.4:

- [#3027](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3027) - Fix command line completion for `set no`
- [#3066](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3066) - Fix ':map' condition (fixes [#3049](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/issues/3049))
- [#3102](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/pulls/3102) - Implement mapping timeout (fixes [#2850](https://github.com/onivim/oni2/issues/2850))

## What's Next

The 0.5.5 build for April will be bit more boring - less shiny features to show, as the the work has been mainly concentrated around bug fixes and some refactoring to prepare for the next round of features. More details to come next month-

Thanks for reading, and for helping us towards achieving this goal of "Modal Editing from the Future"! Your help, feedback, and support has been critical in allowing us to progress and push forward.

Stay safe and healthy!
